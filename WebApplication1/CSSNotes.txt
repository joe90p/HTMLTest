HTML/CSS

In CSS pattern matching rules determine which styles to apply to elemts in the DOM
http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html

These include 

Type selectors

------------------------
body
{
width:40px;
}
------------------------

the universal type selector

*
{
width:40px;
}

this means the style applys to all elements in the DOM.

this means 

class selector

.className
{
width:40px;
}

you can consider a "silent" * here as

*.className
{
...
}

and 

.className
{
width:40px;
}

are equivalent.

you can combine type and class selectors

div.fancy
{
...
}
will match all divs with the class fancy

note that an element can use 2 different classes
e.g <div class="class1 class2" />

Child
    An element A is called the child of element B if and only if B is the parent of A. 
Descendant
    An element A is called a descendant of an element B, if either (1) A is a child of B, or (2) A is the child of some element C that is a descendant of B.

Descendant selectors 

You may want to match an element that is the descendant of another element in the tree. For example match the p elements that are contained by section elements

this can be acheived by using white space
section p
{
color:red;
}

Child selectors 

You may want to match an element that is the child of another element in the tree.For example match the p elements that are children of section elements

this can be acheived by 
section > p
{
color:red;
}

ID selector

#id1
{
...
}
matches all elements with id. These ids should be unique.

//------------------------------

properties

color

colors can have a shorthand property

p 
{
color: #fff
}

is equivalent to
p
{
color:#ffffff
}

This hex digits are identified in pairs.

Dependent on the CSS property definition setting properties on a parent element will cause the child element to inherit those properties.
