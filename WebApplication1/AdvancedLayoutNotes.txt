Positioning

#id01
{
position: absolute;
top:25px;
left:50px;
z-index:0;
}

#id02
{
position: relative;
top:25px;
left:50px;
z-index:1;
}

Absolute positioning positions the elements with starting point of the top left corner of the containing element.

Relative positioning has the starting point of the original unmodified starting point of the element.

Flexbox - 
gives control over child elements.

See Flexbox styles for examples.

To change a div to a flexbox change display property to display: -ms-flexbox. we can also specify a packing for each of the children
within the flexbox.




start - bunches all children to the start. May have the effect of bunching to the left.

end - bunches all children to the start. May have the effect of bunching to the left.
center - bunches al children to center.
justify/distribute - evenly distributes the children

------------------

We can also endow the actual children with flex-box properties e.g -ms-flex

-ms-flex: [relative size] [recomeended size]

--------------

We can also endow the enclosing flexbox with a wrapping property. -ms-flex-wrap: wrap;
